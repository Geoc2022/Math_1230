## Collection of notes for MATH 1230: Graph Theory at Brown University.

Here's a brief overview of what we covered:
- basic properties of graphs (bipartite, Eulerian, matchings, connectivity, colorability, planarity)
- classical theorems about graphs (e.g. Hallâ€™s matching theorem, max-flow/min-cut)
- classical algorithms about graphs (e.g. Gale-Shapely proposal algorithm)
- theoretical trends in graph theory (TONCAS, dual problems, extremal problems, spectral theory)
- applications of graph theory (4-color theorem, applications of Ramsey theory)
